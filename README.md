# 3D Pool Ball Simulation

This is an interactive 3D physics simulation of a spinning cube containing a full set of 16 pool balls. The application is built using `three.js` for 3D rendering and `cannon.js` for the physics engine.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Cube:** A transparent cube that you can spin by clicking and dragging.
- **Realistic Pool Balls:** A full set of 16 pool balls (0-15) with accurate textures, bouncing inside the cube with realistic physics.
- **Color Change:** Press the `Space` bar to change the color of the cube's edges and faces.
- **Zoom:** Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
- **Physics-based Rotation:** The cube's rotation is handled by the physics engine, allowing it to spin based on mouse movement.
